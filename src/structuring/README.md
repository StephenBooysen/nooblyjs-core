# Structure Service

# Backgound
The Structure service is meant to  circumvent a lot of boilerplate code that is used to build  applications that have implemented noobly-core. the key features are:

- Auto loading of routes
- Auto loading of views
- Auto loading of activities
- Auto loading of analytics

# Why
These are created from all the learnings of building the first applications. So although this could be solved by using code generators I am hoping it is valuable
