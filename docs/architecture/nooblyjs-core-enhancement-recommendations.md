- **Filing**: local, ftp, s3, git, gcp, api ‚úÖ (Well covered)
- **DataService**: memory, simpledb, file, mongodb, documentdb, api ‚úÖ (Good NoSQL coverage)
- **Logging**: memory, file, api ‚úÖ (Basic coverage - needs structured logging)
- **AI Service**: claude, chatgpt, ollama, api ‚úÖ (Good coverage)
- **Auth Service**: memory, file, passport, google, api ‚úÖ (Good coverage - needs enterprise)
- **Queueing**: memory, api ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL GAP** (Redis provider needed ASAP)
- **Working**: memory, api ‚ö†Ô∏è (Limited - needs Bull/BullMQ)
- **Measuring**: memory, api ‚ö†Ô∏è (Limited - needs Prometheus)

## üîö **Conclusion**

This revised roadmap prioritizes **low-hanging fruit** over theoretical economic value. By focusing on quick wins first (Month 1), the framework becomes production-ready for distributed systems immediately. The subsequent phases build on this foundation to target progressively larger market segments, culminating in enterprise B2B capabilities by Quarter 2.

**Key Principle:** Ship fast, iterate based on real usage, prioritize production readiness over feature count.

**Recommended Starting Point:** Begin with Redis Queueing Provider - it's the single highest-impact enhancement that unlocks distributed systems, microservices, and horizontal scaling. Everything else builds on this foundation.
