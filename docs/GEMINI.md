*   **User Goals:** What problems does this project solve for the users? What are their primary motivations?

## 3. User Stories / Use Cases
*   List user stories in the format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
    *   Example: As a cache administrator, I want to get a cache value by key so that I can verify its content.
    *   Example: As a cache administrator, I want to save a cache value by key so that I can store new data.
    *   Example: As a cache administrator, I want to delete a cache value by key so that I can remove outdated data.

## 4. Features

    *   Description: Allows users to retrieve a cache value using a specified key.
    *   Requirements:
        *   Input field for cache key.
        *   Button to trigger retrieval.
        *   Display area for the retrieved value or an error message.
*   **Feature 2: Cache Value Storage**
    *   Description: Allows users to store a new cache value or update an existing one using a specified key and value.
    *   Requirements:
        *   Input fields for cache key and value.
        *   Button to trigger saving.
        *   Confirmation message upon successful save or an error message.
*   **Feature 3: Cache Value Deletion**
    *   Description: Allows users to delete a cache value using a specified key.
    *   Requirements:
        *   Input field for cache key.

## 5. Technical Requirements
*   **Architecture:** High-level architectural considerations (e.g., client-server, microservices).
*   **Technology Stack:** Specific technologies to be used (e.g., Node.js, Express, Redis, Memcached, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap).
*   **APIs:** Define the API endpoints for cache operations (e.g., GET /cache/{key}, POST /cache, DELETE /cache/{key}).
*   **Data Storage:** How will cache data be stored (e.g., in-memory, Redis, Memcached, file system)?
*   **Security:** Any security considerations (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption).
*   **Performance:** Expected response times, throughput.
*   **Scalability:** How will the system handle increased load?
*   **Error Handling:** How will errors be handled and communicated to the user?

## 6. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)
*   **Wireframes/Mockups:** (Reference to where these can be found, if applicable).
*   **Design Principles:** Any specific design guidelines or principles to follow (e.g., Material Design, responsive design).
*   **Accessibility:** Considerations for users with disabilities.
